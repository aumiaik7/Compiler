->How to compile and run this project:
-make 				(for compiling the code)
-make clean 			(for cleaning the *.o files and executable file)
-scanner name_of_a_test_file 	(For running the code in some unix distribution ./ is needed before the executable)
-scanner name_of_a_test_file SymbolTable 
				(if "SymbolTable"(case sensitive) is provided in argument the Symbol Table (hash Table) will be shown in terminal)

->The  code is free from compile-time and runtime-errors

->Approximate time spent on this assignment: 28-30 hours
